Getting Started with Create React App
This project is initialized with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can use the following commands:

npm start
Starts the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page will automatically reload as you make changes.
Any lint errors will be shown in the console.

npm test
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.
For details, refer to the running tests documentation.

npm run build
Creates a production build of the app in the build folder.
It optimizes the app for best performance in production mode.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Your application is ready for deployment!

For more information, check the deployment guide.

npm run eject
Warning: This action is irreversible. Once you eject, you cannot revert!

If you need to modify the build tool and configuration settings, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the build dependency and copy configuration files and transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, giving you full control over them. While the other commands will continue to work, they will reference the copied scripts for adjustments. You will then be responsible for all configurations.

Ejecting is optional. The default setup is suitable for most small to medium deployments, and you should only use this feature if you need custom configurations.
